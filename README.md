# Text Mining and NLP APIs

RxNLP's Text Mining and NLP APIs allow for quick analysis of highly messy unstructured text. You can cluster sentences, extract topics, summarize opinions, generate lexical similarities between two pieces of text and more. All of this would allow you to build powerful data-driven applications such as a Tweet Analysis app with tweets clustered into logical topics (using Sentence Clustering), similar Tweets detected using Text Similarity and sentiments in Tweets nicely summarized for users using Opinosis Summarization. 

[PyRxNLP](https://github.com/RxNLP/pyrxnlp) is our Python SDK for these APIs.
